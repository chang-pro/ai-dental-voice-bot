**I built an AI receptionist that picks up the phone, talks to patients naturally, checks the dentist's calendar, books appointments, and sends SMS confirmations — without a human touching anything.**

---

## Why This Matters

Dental offices miss calls. A lot of them. Every missed call is a lost patient worth $500–$2,000/year in recurring visits. Hiring a receptionist costs $30k+/year. This bot handles scheduling 24/7 for a fraction of that.

This isn't a chatbot — it's a **voice AI** that handles real phone calls with natural conversation.

## What I Built

### Conversational Voice Agent (Vapi)
- Integrated **Vapi AI** as the voice layer — handles natural speech recognition and response generation
- The bot understands context: *"I need a cleaning next Tuesday afternoon"* → checks availability → *"I have 2:00 PM and 3:30 PM open. Which works better?"*
- Handles edge cases: no availability, rescheduling, cancellations, questions about services

### Real-Time Calendar Integration
- Connected to **Google Calendar API** to check live availability
- Bot queries open slots in real-time during the call — no stale data
- Books appointments directly on the calendar with patient name, service type, and contact info
- Handles conflicts: if a slot gets taken while the patient is on the phone, the bot offers alternatives

### SMS Confirmation Pipeline
- After booking, automatically sends an **SMS confirmation via Twilio** with:
  - Appointment date, time, and dentist name
  - Office address and contact info
  - Cancellation/rescheduling instructions

### Serverless Backend (Netlify Functions)
Built the entire backend as **serverless functions** — no server to manage, scales automatically:

| Function | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| `check-availability` | Queries Google Calendar for open slots in a date range |
| `book-appointment` | Creates the calendar event + triggers SMS confirmation |
| `status` | Health check endpoint for monitoring uptime |
| `diagnose` | Troubleshooting endpoint that validates all API connections |

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Built a static HTML/JS dashboard for monitoring system health
- Shows API connection status, recent bookings, and error logs
- One-page setup instructions for the dental office
